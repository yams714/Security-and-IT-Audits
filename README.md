Overview:
Welcome to the Security and IT Audit Document, a comprehensive guide aimed at evaluating and enhancing the security and IT infrastructure of our organization. This document serves as a roadmap for conducting audits to ensure compliance, identify vulnerabilities, and fortify the overall security and efficiency of our IT systems.

Included Audits:
Security Audit:

Assess the organization's overall security posture, covering areas such as network security, access controls, incident response preparedness, and physical security measures.
IT Infrastructure Audit:

Examine the entire IT infrastructure, including servers, networks, databases, and endpoints. Evaluate configurations, update procedures, and overall system health.

Tailor the audit to fit the specific requirements of your organization, projects, or compliance standards. The flexibility of the audit roadmaps allows for customization based on unique contexts.
Continuous Improvement:

Utilize the insights gained from the audit to enhance security policies, procedures, and IT infrastructure. Foster a culture of continuous improvement to stay resilient against evolving threats.
Contributions and Feedback:
We welcome contributions and feedback to improve and refine these audits. If you have insights, additional steps, or improvements to suggest, please feel free to contribute. Open an issue or submit a pull request to collaborate on making these audits more effective for our organization.

Thank you for utilizing our Security and IT Audit Document. Wishing you a secure IT environment!

Some codes to get you started with:

1. Network Port Scanning:
   
Use Python with the socket library for a simple port scanner.
python

import socket

target_host = "example.com"

def port_scan(target_host, target_port):
    try:
        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        sock.settimeout(1)
        sock.connect((target_host, target_port))
        print(f"Port {target_port} is open")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Port {target_port} is closed")

# Example: Scan common ports
common_ports = [21, 22, 80, 443, 3389]
for port in common_ports:
    port_scan(target_host, port)

 2. Web Application Security Testing:
Use OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) for automated web application security testing.
python

# Example using ZAP API
from zapv2 import ZAPv2

target_url = "http://example.com"
api_key = "your_api_key"

zap = ZAPv2(apikey=api_key)
zap.urlopen(target_url)

# Perform automated scans
zap.spider.scan(target_url)
zap.pscan.scan(target_url)
zap.ascan.scan(target_url)

# Get results
alerts = zap.core.alerts(baseurl=target_url)
print(alerts)   

3. Password Policy Checker:
Use Python to check password policy compliance.
python

def check_password_policy(password):
    # Example: Check minimum length and complexity
    if len(password) >= 8 and any(char.isupper() for char in password) and any(char.isdigit() for char in password):
        print("Password meets policy requirements")
    else:
        print("Password does not meet policy requirements")

# Example
check_password_policy("SecureP@ssw0rd")

4. File Integrity Checker:
Use Python to calculate and check file integrity using hash functions.
python

import hashlib

def calculate_hash(file_path):
    hasher = hashlib.sha256()
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        while chunk := file.read(8192):
            hasher.update(chunk)
    return hasher.hexdigest()

# Example: Check integrity of a file
file_path = "example.txt"
original_hash = "original_hash_value"  # Replace with the known hash
current_hash = calculate_hash(file_path)

if current_hash == original_hash:
    print("File integrity is maintained")
else:
    print("File integrity compromised")
